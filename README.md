# Final Java Project – Comprehensive Object-Oriented Application

A comprehensive Java console application developed as the final project for **COP2251 – Java Programming**.  
This project integrates all major programming concepts covered throughout the course, including class design, inheritance, polymorphism, arrays, file I/O, and exception handling.

## Project Overview

### Description
This project demonstrates full application development in Java using an object-oriented design.  
It includes multiple classes representing real-world entities, modularized logic, and structured data processing.  
The program performs a combination of input collection, object manipulation, data storage, and formatted output.

### Features
- Implements multiple classes with clear **object-oriented structure**.  
- Demonstrates **inheritance**, **method overriding**, and **polymorphism**.  
- Uses **arrays** or **ArrayLists** to manage collections of data objects.  
- Reads and writes data to external files using `FileReader`, `Scanner`, `PrintWriter`, or `BufferedReader`.  
- Handles exceptions gracefully with `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks.  
- Displays meaningful messages and formatted output in the console.  
- Follows modular and maintainable coding practices with reusable methods.

### Learning Objectives
- Apply complete OOP principles in a multi-class Java project.  
- Demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in an integrated system.  
- Manage external data sources through file input and output operations.  
- Implement robust exception handling and validation for user-driven applications.  
- Reinforce Java syntax, logic, and documentation practices consistent with professional standards.

## Program Structure
1. **Class Definitions** – Define core entities and behaviors with constructors, accessors, and mutators.  
2. **Inheritance Hierarchy** – Extend base classes for specialized behaviors using `extends` and `super`.  
3. **Main Driver Program** – Coordinates input, processing, and output while managing object collections.  
4. **File I/O Processing** – Reads existing data files and writes results or reports.  
5. **Exception Handling** – Ensures stability under invalid or missing data conditions.  

Each module is self-contained and documented for clarity and reusability.
